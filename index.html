    <p> when it comes to Nintendo consoles, they are a blast to use. from various consoles such as the first major handheld console that was foldable with good battery life, the Nintendo DS, to the new generation consoles such as the Nintendo Switch, there are some various consoles to choose from when it comes to hacking. this website serves that purpose. here i will go through various guides, depending on the console you want to hack, and what you will need to go through this. the guides are the Nintendo DS, the Wii, 3DS, Wii U and Switch. alongside the hacking areas, i will also have various facts and history behind these consoles, things i recommend you try, such as various homebrew apps and mods for all the consoles, and try to make this website not just about hacking, but rather a general fun place for Nintendo based fun. if you want to hack something not related to Nintendo, i will update the site as time goes on to support other things such as the iPhones, and Vita. </p>
